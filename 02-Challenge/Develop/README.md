# Week 1 Challenge

## Description

The goal of this project was to refactor the code that was given to me. I examined and improved the existing code to help the understanding of the code. I learned that any little changes you make to the html could possibly directly affect the CSS. Therefore, I had to perform a bit of debugging to fix the areas that connect to to the html that i changed.
